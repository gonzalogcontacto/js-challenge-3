🤖  AI-Powered Image Caption Generator Challenge
==============

  

Welcome to the third challenge of boothack community 🥳 👋🏻 

This challenge involves building a basic image caption generator using JavaScript. You'll learn about image processing, natural language processing (NLP), and how to use AI APIs to enhance your application.

**The Goal:** 🎯
==============
The goal of the challenge is to build a web application that uses an AI API to generate captions for uploaded images. This will involve learning about image processing, natural language processing (NLP), and integrating with an AI API meanwhile you deal with images in forms.

D --> E[Display Caption]
  ```

**Instructions:** 📝
==============

 

1.  **Choose an AI API:** Select a suitable image captioning API from providers like Google Cloud Vision API, Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API, or Clarifai.

2.  **Image Upload:** Create an HTML form that allows users to upload an image.

3.  **API Integration:** Use JavaScript's `fetch` API to send the image to the chosen AI service.

4.  **Caption Display:** Display the generated caption from the API response in a clear and user-friendly format.
